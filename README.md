# CPSC 3720 - Charades

Description:
  This program uses PyGame to create a simple Charades game that can be used to play among teams. A timer is set for 60 seconds at the start of the game, with a new word being selected at the end of each round. If a player would like to select a new card they can click the "new card" button and one will be provided to them.
  
Random Word API:
  A "Random Word API" was used to generate a random set of nouns that are displayed to the user during the game. This API can be found here: https://random-word-form.herokuapp.com/

Install:
  Along with the files provided in the repository, this program requires pygame to run, which can be installed here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
